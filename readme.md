Exercise:

The exercise isn't meant to be too hard. We just want to see how you code.
Also, this is not supposed to take too long, so if you get near the 1 hour mark, jot some notes about what you would do if you had more time. Use Ruby, and write production quality code.

Without using any date/time library, write a function or method that accepts two mandatory arguments.
The first argument is a string of the format[H]H:MM {AM|PM} and the second argument is an integer. Assume the integer is the number of minutes to add to the string. The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first argument. For example add_minutes('9:13 AM', 10) would return 9:23 AM.
